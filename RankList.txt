/*
Ability points (AP). 
Non-story criitical staff or unique staff (such as Hideo) are
generated with a set of points in each area (see section 3 for 
how they are generated). If these points exceed a certain threshold 
the staff gets assigned that rank in that field. Unfortunately the 
game does not present us with a clear number next to each of the 
bars but with some data mining the numbers can be found: 
E: 1-15
D: 16-31
C: 32-47
B: 48-63
A: 64-79
A+: 80-109
A++: 110-184
S: 185-289
S+: 290-447
S++: 448+
